Reasonable questions:
- What is this tool?
    - A simple GUI that allows for offsetting or flipping loaded sprites.

- How do I use it?
    - Compile in Godot normally, there are no other dependencies. Load the sprites you would like to edit from the file menu, then use the sliders and checkboxes to apply changes to the currently selected sprite. You can save the currently selected sprite, or apply and save the current settings to every sprite you have loaded. It saves in-place.
